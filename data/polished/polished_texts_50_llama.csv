1,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Another week has flown by, and I drove by the new house yesterday, admiring the front window, covered in boxes. I'm getting increasingly excited as we're set to close on Wednesday. I was up until 3 00am last night, watching movies with Bethany. There's been a lot of movie watching around here lately. Here's my rundown  we watched thirteen, a movie every mother of a teen should see. It was better than I expected. Then we watched Gigli, yeah, it was just as bad as the media said it was, but we had to see for ourselves."
2,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Summer TV used to be a barren landscape of reruns, but now there are two exceptional new shows that have captured my attention. I've been watching them religiously for a week. One of these shows is a peculiar concept that surprisingly lacks any openly gay individuals. Hairstylist Jonathan Antin aims to expand his successful West Hollywood salon to Beverly Hills. Initially, I wouldn't have given it a second thought, but while channel-surfing, I stumbled upon Jonathan, who exudes narcissism and dullness, standing in an empty space on Rodeo Drive, proclaiming (in a public voice) ""I will create the greatest salon in the history of the world!"" I was hooked. Not since Rocco have I found a character as fascinatingly incompetent to watch."
3,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"What a week has been challenging for me. My right shoulder has tendonitis, located under my shoulder blade. When I move my arm excessively, mainly when using a mouse on a computer, it exacerbates the condition. I'm currently struggling to find the strength to draw anything, as I was on a marathon of updating my website and working on other online projects. Lack of sleep is also adding to my discomfort. I'm not feeling too well at the moment, but I'll get better. My mom's surgery went well, and her eyesight has shown some improvement. She can now see fuzzy shapes and make out colors. However, she still has a long way to go before fully regaining her vision."
4,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Kindness of strangers - Attempted laundry with the kids in tow and realized how quickly the simplest things can become a daunting ordeal. I learned how remarkably sweet total strangers can be for no reason other than because they feel like being kind. It wasn't like they were trying to get into my pants or anything. I had kid drool all over me and was wearing my 'wash-day' outfit. Also, I'm not sure I'll ever be bathing again, so it's not like there was even an olfactory incentive there!"
5,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"As I sit in my bedroom at 11:14pm MST, I'm currently fixing the personal computer of my job's personnel director. While I don't mind doing it, I sometimes wonder where the line is drawn between helping others and being taken advantage of. I'm grateful to be able to serve and minister to people in this way, but I also need to prioritize my own needs. The past couple of weeks, I've been staying up late, reading and unwinding, so I was looking forward to an early night's rest. However, I realized it would be more practical to get this computer back to its owner as soon as possible. With a sigh, I settled in for another evening of watching Joe Schmo 2."
6,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Remind me, what did I write about before this? Or, a continuation in the 'is this a date?' saga, so after the weird lunch, my confidence shook, I forgot to tell you guys an important piece of the story. As we chatted, Dustan starts discussing what a nice guy Pat is and how he's trying to find a girlfriend for him. I'm listening and nodding, realizing we're talking more about finding Dustan's best friend a girl than discussing whatever it is you discuss with a stranger over pink lemonade."
7,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I implore everyone to pause and reflect before acting. I believe it would be beneficial if each individual made a conscious decision to think critically throughout their day, and if they're not prepared to do so, I suggest they return to bed and indulge in a restful slumber. I am frustrated with the lack of thoughtfulness in some individuals. While I'm not claiming to be the most intelligent person, I do believe it's reasonable to address the thoughtless actions of others. Let's focus on a specific subset of these behaviors for now, and we can reserve the rest for another time, if you agree."
8,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Two problems with the scenario outlined in my previous post  1. The Bush administration's economic stimulus is stimulating the economy, but in the wrong way. According to Robert Rubin, the former Treasury Secretary, the same stimulus effect could have been achieved without the long-term debt hangover by enacting different tax cuts, temporary tax cuts that would benefit low- and middle-income persons. Ah, Robert Rubin, the sound of his name is music to our ears. Quickly, can you name a Bush administration cabinet official with Rubin's gravitas? Still thinking? It'll come to you... 2. We can't give the Republicans control only in wartime because they've ingeniously concocted an endless, global 'war on terrorism.'"
10,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Do you ever have those moments when you begin to reflect on life, sitting in a math class, feeling bored out of your skull, wondering what exactly goes on in your brain that makes you understand math? You realize you exist and are in math class, and suddenly it hits you – the fact that you're on this random train of thought is incredibly pathetic. Ever had that happen? I hate that. You know what else I hate? Block schedules. Who would ever come up with that idea? Anyone can see that sitting through a 2.5-hour class in any subject is cruel and unusual punishment."
11,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I've come to the realization that my time with Monopoly has come to an end, and I've vowed to never touch that iron again. Tonight, Andy beat me by a small margin, and I let him win the game, as I wanted him to feel good on his last night here. The story may have unfolded, but I've developed a Texas-sized headache, which the Aleve has somewhat alleviated. Now, I just need some well-deserved rest and relaxation."
12,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Well, today has been a long day. We drove home from Indiana. I'm not sure how much time and space I'll take up, as I'm rather exhausted. I'll try to be concise. I must say that camp was amazing and exceeded my expectations. God has been doing a lot in my life lately, and it's incredible. I've turned a new leaf, but I'm back to the beginning. We arrived at the Twiggs' house on Friday evening and stayed until we left for camp on Monday. We spent most of our time at the fair, church, a parade, Walmart, and watching movies."
13,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Today is my last day of summer vacation! And I have a dentist appointment at 9. I dislike the idea, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation. I'm definitely nervous, anxious, and apprehensive about the experience. This is going to be a significant change for me. As a perfectionist, I strive for excellence in everything I do. However, starting new things can be challenging. I dislike being a pawn, as I told Cassie, ""I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight."""
14,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Arun Shourie highlights the prescient warning issued by the current Governor of Uttar Pradesh as far back as 1996, cautioning against the looming threat of a ""third Islamic State"" in the subcontinent. T.V. Rajeswar, the former head of the Intelligence Bureau and current Governor of Uttar Pradesh, had predicted this dire threat in a series of articles published in the Hindustan Times. Shourie poses a valid question, asking whether the fact that Rajeswar, not he or Mr. Advani, wrote these warnings makes them more credible or whether one concludes that Rajeswar's warnings are tainted by communalism and therefore he should not continue as Governor."
15,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"It's been a long day in the trenches, and I'm looking forward to tonight. I'm afraid I haven't had much time to write anything for you readers, but I'm glad to see Tigger taking the reins and making an appearance. She's talking about things, and I don't have much to say about that. Yesterday, I attended a Shakespeare play on the green, which was lovely, but I had to leave before the curtain closed, which was a bit disappointing. I hope to see the entire play someday. In other news, Akcron is correct about the shower issues - it's not great for laughing at oneself in the shower, as people's reactions can be quite entertaining."
16,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I've been overwhelmed with exhaustion for the past two days, feeling bone-deep tiredness. Last night, I went home and collapsed onto my bed, not even bothering to change into something more comfortable, and I only stirred when my mother called me at 8 30 PM. When I finally woke up, it was pitch black outside, and I hadn't even bothered to switch on the lights, so for a few disoriented seconds, it was just my mother's voice in the darkness and me struggling to regain my bearings. I couldn't help but wonder why I was feeling so drained... The morning was surprisingly pleasant, with a gentle drizzle outside. Although I'd been told it's been raining nonstop in Calcutta for the past three days."
17,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Last night was a disappointing evening. I regretfully discarded the sweater I was knitting, having only completed about 14 inches. I lost approximately $10 worth of yarn, as it costs $8 per skein. Unfortunately, the yarn became too knotted by the time I reached the arm holes, and the mohair was tangling itself together as I knitted. Frogging, or ripping out rows, did not prove effective. The yarn broke frequently. I refrained from cursing, which is unusual for me. Instead, I simply ripped and listened to the second season of Sex and the City. Eventually, I grew tired of it and discarded the project. Although I didn't achieve my goal, I suppose I learned a valuable lesson from the experience."
18,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Last night in class, we discussed the assigned reading, ""Getting Back into Place  Toward a Renewed Study of the Place-World"" by Edward S. Casey. The first chapter explores the concepts of ""implacement"" and ""displacement."" Casey makes a compelling argument that our contemporary world and culture are centered around time as the situating force  we're constantly racing against time, we've saved time, and we're just in time. He posits that using place as the foundation of culture fosters a more grounded community."

And while giggling is good, one wonders if we would have found ourselves up that fire escape drinking beer in the fierce wind had we not been eating them earlier. Finding ourselves in a doorway to a bar sadly closed for business, we stopped to examine an office-supplies catalogue that had arrived in the post. It was a lucky find. Who could possibly have guessed that within these pages were the special offers of a lifetime? Not I, for certain. I list but a few  buy 36 permanent marker pens, get a stunt kite. Buy 30 lever arch files, get a barbecue."
20,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Currently listening to ""The Little Drummer Boy"" by Stevan Pasero...and now my post... Senate Republicans, okay, hands up - who watched the 39-hour judicial nominations marathon last week? I know I didn't. Well, okay - I did tune in once or twice. The entire colossal waste of time was perpetrated by Republicans who, peeved that Democrats wouldn't roll over and nominate four of Bush's justices, were trying to score political points by holding a multi-day spectacle. Never mind the fact that the Democrats have already approved 168 of Bush's judicial nominees - no, that's not good enough for the power-hungry Republicans who are somehow under the misapprehension they have a huge mandate for this kind of nonsense."
21,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"This was a fulfilling weekend. I spent a lot of time outdoors, after a long hiatus, and indulged in a lot of music, something I should have started doing sooner. I finished three books over the weekend - Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather, Larry Niven's World of Ptavvs, and Octavia Butler's Parable of the Sower. Heavy Weather was a compelling cyberpunk thriller set in a near-future USA ravaged by global warming and anarchy. While it was well-crafted and engaging, I must admit that I didn't come away with any profound insights or lasting impressions about the story or characters. Not that they aren't well-developed and vividly portrayed - it's a good book, but not a masterpiece, I suppose."
22,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"This is the aftermath of the first week back from practicum, which was a struggle, but it's only in the second week that the smoke has really started to clear. Post-practicum trauma is a hidden epidemic that's only now coming to light. I was struck, but the eventual meeting with the course coordinator allowed me to release my burden, and by doing so, I have prevented another person from being stuck with such a pedagogically deficient practicum school. Yesterday, I bumped into another agrieved classmate who was quite determined to go to the student who was due to go to her school in the next practicum and tell him how terrible it will be. I calmed her down and suggested we go to the administrator first."
23,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Well, things can get busy here at times, but there's always time for stress-relieving activities. I've found that I'm not exactly skilled at 8-ball and ping pong! Rick, a regular opponent, consistently beats me. Our building's front lobby features a ping pong table, always available for a quick game. Last night, I participated in an 8-ball tournament at the recreation tent, where I had a decent showing, despite scratching on the eight ball. The highlight was the two Dutch soldiers who joined the tournament, making it a fun and lively atmosphere."
24,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"Fall 1974  I was attempting for what felt like the 13th time to fight my way through the second chapter of my high school algebra book. As a non-math person, I hate math and am math-phobic, so I struggled to make sense of it. Just as I was finding a glimmer of understanding, the doorbell rang. I put down my book and went to open the door, only to find no one there. Returning to my studies, I was about to resume my efforts when the doorbell rang again. Once more, no one was at the door, leaving me to wonder what a struggling math student needs – an uninvited practical joker."
25,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"This past week has been nothing short of exhausting. I spent Tuesday to Thursday finishing the move to my new classroom. The new room is bigger and closer to my grade-level team, these are the things I need to consider as I spend hours upon hours preparing my room for this year. Had I known I was going to move prior to the end of my school year, I would have discarded much of the books and supplies I no longer use. Unfortunately, it all came with me. So, this week was spent moving, unpacking, and purging profusely. I have to thank my teammate, Jill, for helping with all of this. She was still teaching this month in my old room, so she and her lovely students moved almost my entire room for me!"
26,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"You can't help but feel it; a piece of you will always live within me. Even if I never carried you as a child, even if I was never married to you, even if I was never an official pair to you... I loved you immensely, and to this day, the feeling carries an echo through my heart. Forever will I always be reminded of the few nights we spent together, our hearts and limbs entwined in a soul-embrace, drenched in the salty darkness of an evening by the beach... or a kiss under the rain. Whenever I get the feeling of a dark glass piercing my heart, you will be there. That piece of you... the eternal love that once lived within me... and still remains."
27,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"I'm uncomfortable with investigative reporting. The article I'm working on and its consequences is not something I'm entirely comfortable with. Perhaps it's because I don't believe in it enough, which makes it difficult for me to fully immerse myself in the story. The underlying passion behind it. The full-out commitment to questioning it is what's missing. I've grown up in a country where you don't ask questions. In fact, you're not really encouraged to question anything. They might even put you in jail for speaking out of turn. I'm not used to this freedom of speech – not used to speaking out loud."
28,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,blog,"We embarked on an outing with my colleagues from the bank to Guintubdan, La Carlota, a destination new to most of us. Our 30-minute trek led us to the falls, where we caught our breaths, exclaiming ""whew!"" as we reached the spot. The icy water left our bodies numb, but we only stayed for under an hour before heading to the nearby waterfalls. Another 30 minutes of trekking followed, but the journey was worthwhile. The falls' calming presence and breathtaking scenery left us in awe. The experience was like being one with nature, and soaking in the cold water felt like communing with Mother Earth. The refreshing air and water lulled us into a state of tranquility."

Thank goodness I brought a bag of eggs with me, just in case. So Connor had a great time finding eggs out in the park. Sunday morning when he woke up, he was so excited the Easter bunny had come. There's nothing better than seeing the excitement on your child's face. After egg hunting, we all went to church. Even though the Easter bunny is fun and all, we do make sure our kids know the true meaning of the holidays. This was Megan's first Easter, she looked so cute in her jeans dress and stockings."

I somehow managed to get a flat tire. Luckily, I'm at work, so the team is going to inflate it for me and ensure it holds air. If not, they'll change my tire and slap the spare on it.

If Grays Harbor paper notifies RT of a unit derate or outage RT should notify BPA dispatch immediately and make the reduction in the schedule during the next ramp.

While it does provide more story context, the combat feels sloppy and lacks the sharpness Arkham City achieved in its combat mechanics. As of the time of writing this review (October 26, 2013), there is a game-breaking bug that prevents a side mission from being completed (the main story is not affected). Some gadgets are placed at an inconvenient hotkey that requires you to traverse the entire keyboard to access it, which might seem minor, but could potentially disrupt your combo in combat."
99,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"They basically fixed Shadow Warrior 2013, i.e., the boss fights are awesome, weapons feel very nice, maybe not as good as D44m's ones, but still solid, enemies aren't too spongy if you're not too much of a retard with handling elemental and upgrade stuff. The upgrade system is really balanced and once you get around it, it's not too tedious. The elemental stuff and limited ammo softly forces you to use different weapons. Lots of cool unique weapons that stay viable through most of the game."
100,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"So many things went wrong. I'm struggling to start this review. This all relates to my career.

Why can a person who has 1.74m not become as good in shooting as a person with 1.71m? I'm 1.87m in RL, made my first player with this height and noticed then I can't reach a higher skill than 89.

101,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I think this Assassin's Creed nailed the mechanics down on all fronts (ship battles, sailing, hunting, parkour, etc.). I felt much more attached to this character as well. The story starts out extremely rough but does get much better as you play. Edward was quite the interesting character and so were all the side characters. I felt like all the collectibles actually meant something in this AC game that I never got from any of the previous ones, and maybe it's because I felt like they had a bigger purpose in the game. They definitely were not required but they were fun to get and you got rewarded in a very balanced way."
102,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"While I personally cannot recommend this game, it wasn't absolutely terrible. The gunplay is alright, so long as you have the money to purchase gun parts, which would be my main complaint with this game  it's pay-to-win. If I could get past that, the game would be enjoyable, as the hardsuit is fun to use and hardsuit is an excellent idea. I'd take this game over any call of duty title any day, but its pay-to-win microtransaction format is off-putting for me."
103,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"While not perfect, this game has been greatly enjoyable. The save system and possibility of sudden death lead to some frustration. I'm on my first playthrough and I lost my main character around hour 10 of 20 hours. I would have really liked a save to reload at that point. I've since picked up a third-party mod/save tool to avoid catastrophic failures. The aiming reticule is on the small side, and zoom is underpowered. With all that said, it's been a blast. I'm not normally a zombie fan, but the combination of strategy, missions, first-person shooter/beat 'em up is great. I've been playing it as often as I can get away, just one more mission, just one more supply run, or I'm running away and want to get safe before shutting the game down."
104,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"An absolute great strategy game! Having played every single other war game (European Escalation and Alpha), I have to say this one fits well. The number of units is great. The graphics are just beautiful, the sounds are great, and the gameplay overall is epic. The in-game chat box at the main menu is very entertaining, I am not kidding. However, if you think this game is 'easy', or if you are new to the strategy genre, it could take you quite some time to get it nailed down. Don't get upset, you will lose a lot of units. Just make sure you plan ahead, always have anti-air, and anti-tank."
105,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I was initially skeptical about this game before playing it. I wasn't even sure about buying it. The portal gun and portal concept seemed unusual to me, even though I enjoy science fiction. I was wrong. The humor and voice acting in this game are phenomenal. They're not cheesy (okay, they're occasionally cheesy). The different story characters all have their own sense of humor. Those distinct characters genuinely have different personalities. And the level design is just fantastic. By the way, I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have played it if I hadn't played the sequel."
107,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for thirty-somethings who remember watching the ever-irritating Transformers cartoon. The voice actors for Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee, and many others are back, instantly recognizable. The distinctive cartoon transformation sound is present. Graphically, the cell-shaded presentation is perfect, and very, very Generation One. The combat mechanics are extremely well-done. Transforming mid-fight is often a necessity, seamlessly integrated into combos, making it unlike other high-profile games. Another distinction is the heavy focus on melee combat, but some enemies (e.g., Seekers) require a switch to a ranged blaster."
108,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I downloaded the game and played it for a bit, but it was unremarkable. I spent more time trying to log in than actually playing the game. There's a frustrating bug where it insists on updating the terms of service, only to prompt me to restart the client when I click ""accept."" I'm not thrilled about linking my Steam and Gface accounts, as it seems unnecessary for DLC and non-reversible, allowing a company I don't care about to access my Steam information. The game itself is unimpressive, easily recognizable as a Call of Duty clone, and somehow they managed to make the gunplay worse."

110,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I experienced no performance problems even at release, and after all these patches, it plays really well. In my opinion, this is a really great and fun game, although the format may be somewhat annoying (where the free-roam city area repopulates with new enemies every time you progress the story). I particularly enjoyed the 'dual play' segments, where you can play Batman + one more, and the ability to use the controller for most segments of the game, but the mouse and keyboard for the tank combat segments was greatly appreciated. Driving your Batmobile around the free-roam city, including when chasing the APC commanders, is actually quite enjoyable once you figure out how to use the brakes to skid around corners, and when you master that, driving around the city is really quite enjoyable."

It has great FPS, nice story, cool characters, and a great soundtrack, but some cutscenes can be quite cruel and vivid. If you're not prepared, it's not for the faint of heart. However, when a game is this good, it's easier to spot the flaws, and here they are  no SLI support, which was a problem for me since I had to put the game away until I upgraded my card. Make sure you have a decent single GPU card."

The graphics can be set on 'high' without straining your system. I played this game on an i5 processor with an Nvidia GeForce 710M card and 8GB of RAM, running Windows 8.1, and it ran smoothly. The controls are versatile, allowing players to play with a keyboard and mouse or an Xbox controller."

This is everything I wished for in a search game from Cod would be. However, don't buy this game thinking it's like Cod, Battlefield, or any other shooter game. It's a game in its own class and should be treated as such. I've heard numerous times new players complain about getting killed really fast. Oh, the horror! It's not like that doesn't happen in real life or anything. I've been playing this game for a while now, throwing all kinds of money at it. It's one of the best multiplayer games around. A good thing to play when you're not feeling CS GO."

The gameplay is solid, the art design is beautiful, the music is surprisingly high-quality and fitting, the story/world has me hooked, and the puzzles are fun. But the best part about this game is the comedy. If you've played any RPG since the dawn of video game RPGs, you'll laugh at the various jokes, parodies, and references; if you've never played an RPG before, you should still enjoy the game for its humor."
115,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I'm really sorry to say that I didn't enjoy this game, despite its promising description. As a fan of free-to-play games and indie developers, I was excited to try this game, but unfortunately, the execution fell short of my expectations. As someone who loves puzzle and exploration games, I found this game to be frustratingly unintuitive, and even after seeking guidance, I struggled to find the gameplay enjoyable. The lack of a pause button is also a significant oversight, especially given the timed sequences in the game. It feels like the game is more cutscene than gameplay, leaving me feeling bored and impatient."
116,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game was an absolute delight from start to finish. I was hooked from the story to the graphics. The story wasn't just a narrative, it felt like I was that person, trying to figure out what came next in the story my character was telling. Gameplay was excellent and I learned a lot about myself through this game, mainly my fear of heights, which I never had an issue with until the ice caverns. My stomach churned the whole time, but I persisted for Uncle Fred!"

In this game, you are set in the future on a mission to colonize a new planet. I enjoy the game's new approach and added mechanics, such as the affinity system and orbital layer. However, I didn't enjoy that the game could be overwhelming at times. To improve this game, incorporating new artwork, such as the environment you experience when communicating with another leader, could be a great addition."

After playing 60+ hours, I can honestly say this is one of the better, more realistic zombie games. It's very much designed like a survival horror, as you must save up your ammo, heal your own wounds when you bleed out, take pills when you're infected, etc. I find zombies to feel very natural to be well animated for a free-to-play game. I would recommend getting one or two friends to play with, but the community is super friendly, and you can usually make friends/talk with the people in the chat or over voice comms."

No Aussie servers - one red bar puts you at a severe disadvantage, and creates unbearable lag. Mind you, I played through the offline training mode and it was stuttering and lagging as well (how does that even happen?). Couple that with the poor ping, and it just ruins the game. Everything's artifacts like crazy - the menus, backgrounds, training, and in-game. I've never had this happen before with this card, and thought it might not like my OC."
120,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I finished the game last night, and while the story isn't particularly deep or captivating, the storytelling is what makes it stand out. The atmosphere is richly detailed, and the many collectibles do an excellent job of fleshing it out. I learned a lot about the world of Batman, so it was a slight letdown that there were so few boss battles. However, there are enough future games to rectify that. The combat is the right amount of challenge, but it's on the easier side. Leveling up Batman wasn't particularly satisfying. It's the gadgets you upgrade and acquire during the campaign that add nice new gameplay mechanics. Getting access to previously unreachable places makes for a sense of progression."

This masterpiece represents the pinnacle of storytelling in my opinion, and the soundtrack is a gorgeously charming and perfect accompaniment. Yes, the controls are a bit finicky, but the story is so fantastic that I did not care one bit. Plus, the humor is great and it definitely does not intrude upon the distinguished nature of the story... And the references are endless."

The game offers a wide range of choices, allowing you to decide what to build for an advantage, what weapons to wield, and what power-ups to have on those weapons, as well as what drinks to consume for a bonus effect. The art style and music are fantastic, making the game visually stunning and engaging. Additionally, the game features narration that adapts to the player's actions, so if you pick up a weapon and switch it for another in the armory, the narration will reflect your new selection."

All the guns at this stage were equally overpowered, so there were no balance issues; anyone could kill anyone at any time. Additionally, the game used to provide unlimited gun slots and five loadouts. You might think that for a game with 'billions of guns', they would at least offer more than 6 weapon slots and 3 loadouts before you had to pay to access more. At one point, I had about 3 pages worth of guns and was planning on new ideas for more, as personally, that's where I found it most enjoyable."
124,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"This game was a surprising gem, with rave reviews often reflecting the fun of this neat little game. It's an odd mix between a classic 2D platformer and an MOBA, done with style. I found myself enjoying characters I wouldn't typically enjoy in other MOBA games. I had expected this trait to continue, but decided to give a melee tank a go anyway. I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome and ended up trying out more as they were unlocked from playing games."

The music perfectly sets the mood, the sound effects are spot on, and the controls are superb. I eagerly anticipate each combat, and they've executed combat extremely well. I had some reservations about the naval combat system, but it's so much fun to unleash havoc on multiple fleets at once! The only way to lose in this game is to fail to retreat. If the combat appears overwhelming, simply regroup and counter-assault. Thank you, developers, for an incredible experience!"

While fans of the original series may be upset at the change to their beloved character, it's certainly for the better; and this new game by Ninja Theory proves it. DMC serves as the perfect point for newcomers to jump into the series. It shows the origins of an arrogant, cynical Dante, and it chronicles his journey from cynicism to selflessness. Throughout, the game weaves a clear, narrative arc for the new Dante, making him a compelling character to watch."
127,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"Where do I start on this enchanting game? It's story is absolutely charming. It has so much detail invested in it, and it's a bundle of happiness, bad puns, and secrets. The character design is on point, with various characters having distinct personalities and secrets to them. It stands out from other RPGs because you don't have to kill anyone, which is an innovative concept in RPGs. With lots of inspiration from Earthbound, one of the best RPGs I've seen, you can tell it's going to be great. It easily has the best soundtrack I've heard in a while."
128,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"I recommend this experience solely because it's free and may be a more enjoyable experience for others. For my part, the game didn't resonate with me. Half the story relies on shock value, but I wasn't shocked or emotionally moved in any way. Perhaps I'm desensitized or maybe it was too simplistic to elicit a reaction from me. The other half of the game attempts to paint a picture of a person's mental decline. It explores obsession, hallucinations, depression, and a few other themes. In theory, it's an innovative concept. However, the game took me 10 minutes to complete, and that's including reading and absorbing every detail."

Divinity  Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite RTS game. Combine this with a huge risk-like grand strategy mode, and there, it hits the spot. I am not (read  try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a dragon, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time. Honestly, I do like the complicated RTS games nowadays. Think of Civ V and so on."
132,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"The game Undertale comes together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. The graphics are solid for a retro title and the music is nice, but paired together they make some truly beautiful and impactful moments. The script runs the gamut from comedic to dramatic to heartbreaking to hopeful, sometimes all at once, and does this while turning RPG tropes on their head. It's a game that turns RPG cliches on their head, but in a way that feels fresh and original."

There is a steep learning curve to the game's mechanics, which I'm still trying to master; however, this breadth of strategy allows for a myriad of ways to achieve goals and capitalize on certain situations.

Unfortunately, it's far from it. In this game, you absorb ever-larger objects to grow bigger and absorb even larger objects. However, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it could be; the levels are not inventive and what's in it is a surreal horror show. I don't mean an entertaining horror show, but one that makes you question whether being alive is all it should be. Every 'living' creature in this game, from small pets to human beings, makes me wonder if the creators of this game had an interest in taxidermy."

However, it wasn't as enjoyable as I had hoped. The game starts by asking you to choose a side  Republican or Democrat, with no independent or third-party option. A little disappointed, I was still optimistic and decided to see what I could do. I will give the game credit, the character customization, although limited, is pretty fun to play around with. It's the only time it's an option to wear your head or not in a campaign, literally."

Some keys are hard-coded and cannot be rebound. Bugs abound. My Pip-Boy disappeared permanently at one point, and I had to research console commands to get it back. Power armor is readily available, as it's basically given to you from the beginning of the game, and power cores are abundant in trader shops. The value of power armor has diminished greatly from previous Fallout games. The story is mediocre, with everything about this game being average except for its stability. It doesn't crash every 10 minutes like Fallout 3, making it a more stable experience. However, it's not better than Fallout 3, and it's not better than New Vegas.

Beyond that, the game's initial awe-inspiring universe scale was a hindrance to my enjoyment.

144,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,game_review,"My favorite first-person shooter of all time is a hands-down favorite. Run-and-gun rambos need not apply; recoil and ballistics are realistic. A single hit to the chest, neck, or head from rifle-caliber weapons almost always results in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required to remain on target. There's no magical ammunition pool. If you reload halfway through your magazine, you'll have a pouch full of half-full mags. You can't run forever; if you sprint for a while, your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you've caught your breath. Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing."

I loved that game, however, it was unforgiving in the early stages but rewarding when you did things right. As for XCOM2, I love it; the game plays well for me on medium settings, and I'm running a GTX 560 with 2GB of VRAM. Initially, the game set it to high and it was running a bit sluggishly, but not to the point of being unplayable. When I dropped it down to medium, it smoothed out. I'm not sure if I'm just lucky when it comes to having issues with games or what, but it seems that most of the negative reviews sound like they're coming from some really entitled people."

Although there's a limited variety of equipment and leveling skills, it still feels like there's always another ship to unlock or skill to level up. The best way to increase the life of this game is through mods. The fight for universe is easily the star, but the big fight for beef is also very good."

GM, whose European operations are currently losing money, no longer wishes to own the unprofitable Fiat unit.

GM is reportedly offering approximately $2 billion (£1.06 billion) to extricate itself from the arrangement.

This can break the axial and equatorial symmetry of the Kerr metric and have a much richer multipolar structure, providing a portal to constrain fuzzball models phenomenologically. We find numerical evidence that all multipole moments are typically larger (in absolute value) than those of a Kerr black hole with the same mass and spin.

The nonparametric formulation of this approach, known as modal clustering, draws a correspondence between the groups and the domains of attraction of the density modes. Operationally, a nonparametric density estimate is required, and a proper selection of the amount of smoothing, governing the shape of the density and hence possibly the modal structure, is crucial to identify the final partition."

However, helicity selection rules for the diboson scattering amplitudes set an obstruction to the naive interference contributions of dimension six operators, causing the total diboson rate correction's leading contribution to cancel. In this case, carefully measuring the azimuthal decay angles resurrects the interference, recouping sensitivity to the non-interfering operators. We explore these signatures in detail, and find that the EFT uncertainties associated with higher-dimensional operators are uniquely well-suppressed by the construction of an asymmetry variable which is only generated by these non-interfering operators, relegating the effects of higher-dimensional, interfering operators to the same status as statistical errors in this observable."

This note shows that, for a generic Einstein quantum theory of gravity in AdS, the stability of extremal black branes is in tension with rigorously proven quantum information theorems about entanglement entropy.

Ultracold 2D Fermi gases have emerged as clean and controllable model systems to study the interplay of strong correlations and reduced dimensionality, but direct evidence of superfluidity in these systems has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate superfluidity in an ultracold 2D Fermi gas by moving a periodic potential through the system and observing no dissipation below a critical velocity vc. We measure vc as a function of interaction strength, finding a maximum in the crossover regime between bosonic and fermionic superfluidity. Our measurement establishes ultracold Fermi gases as a powerful tool for studying the influence of reduced dimensionality on strongly correlated superfluids, providing new insights into the long-standing problem of unconventional superconductivity."

Despite ODE's wide usage in modeling, frequent absence of their analytic solutions makes it difficult to estimate ODE parameters from the data, especially when the model has many variables and parameters. This paper proposes a Bayesian ODE parameter estimating algorithm, which is fast and accurate even for models with many parameters. The proposed method approximates an ODE model with a state-space model based on equations of a numeric solver.

220,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"We study the transport properties and superconducting proximity effect in nSN junctions formed by a time-reversal symmetry broken Weyl semimetal (WSM) in proximity to an s-wave superconductor. We find that the differential conductance and induced pairing amplitudes strongly depend on the angle between the junction direction in real space and the axis separating the Weyl nodes in momentum space. We identify the influence of a chiral chemical potential, i.e., the electron population imbalance between Weyl nodes of opposite chirality, on the transport characteristics of the junction. Remarkably, we observe a net spin polarization of Cooper pairs that are generated via Andreev reflection in the two WSM regions. The spin polarization is opposite in the two WSM regions and highly sensitive to the chirality imbalance and excitation energy."
221,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Metal ion implantation into ceramics has been demonstrated to be an effective and controllable technique for tailoring the surface electrical conductivity of the ceramic piece, and this approach has been used in a number of applications. Importantly, it provides a method for grading the voltage drop across high-voltage insulators, thereby increasing the maximum operational voltage that can be applied across the insulator without surface flashover. The long-term stability of the implantation-induced conductivity is a concern, especially if the implanted metal species is readily oxidized. Our examination of the long-term behavior of titanium-implanted alumina reveals that after an initial drop of up to 40% in the first few weeks after implantation, the conductivity shows a very slow decrease of approximately 10% over the following year."
222,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"We introduce a novel, Skyrme-like conserved current in the effective theory of pions and vector mesons, rooted in the concept of hidden local symmetry. The associated charge is equivalent to the Skyrme charge for any smooth configuration. Notably, singular configurations can be identified as n_f=1 baryons, charged under the new symmetry. Under this identification, vector mesons assume the role of Chern-Simons vector fields residing on the quantum Hall droplet forming the n_f=1 baryon. We propose this current as the correct effective expression for the baryon current at low energies, yielding a unified framework for both types of baryons and enabling a natural transformation between them. Furthermore, Chern-Simons dualities on the droplet can be interpreted as a result of Seiberg-like duality between gluons and vector mesons."
223,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Interfacial spin-orbit coupling in Josephson junctions offers an intriguing means to combine anomalous Hall and Josephson physics in a single device. We theoretically investigate how the superposition of both effects influences the transport properties of superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator/superconductor junctions. The transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs through the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface generates sizable transverse Hall supercurrents, which we refer to as anomalous Josephson Hall effect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, initially established for usual tunneling Josephson current flows, to evaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their amplitudes are widely adjustable via the spin-orbit coupling strengths or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. A clear spectroscopic fingerprint of Josephson junctions, well-localized subgap bound states form around the interface."

Dry (or the ""loss-cone"") EMRIs, previously considered as the main EMRI sources for the laser interferometer space antenna, are primarily produced by multi-body scattering in the nuclear star cluster and gravitational capture. We highlight an alternative EMRI formation channel  wet EMRI formation assisted by the accretion flow around accreting galactic-center massive black holes (MBHs). This channel captures stellar-mass black holes initially moving on inclined orbits and subsequently drives them to migrate towards the MBH, boosting the formation rate of EMRIs in such galaxies by orders of magnitude."

228,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Deep learning has successfully solved many problems that are out of reach for heuristic algorithms. It has also been successfully applied in wireless communications, even though optimal algorithms exist for many tasks. While some gains have been obtained by learning individual parts of a receiver, a better approach is to jointly learn the whole receiver. This, however, often results in a challenging nonlinear problem, for which the optimal solution is infeasible to implement. To this end, we propose a deep fully convolutional neural network, deeprx, which executes the whole receiver pipeline from frequency domain signal stream to uncoded bits in a 5g-compliant fashion. We facilitate accurate channel estimation by constructing the input of the convolutional neural network in a very specific manner using both the data and pilot symbols."

To address this, fuzzers come with distillation tools that select the smallest subset of seeds that triggers the same range of instrumentation data points as the full corpus. We present results of 34+ cpu-years of fuzzing with five distillation approaches to understand their impact in finding bugs in real-world software."

The agents can be divided into several groups, in each of which the agents have similar isomorphic state transition structures, and thus can be relabeled into the same template. Based on the template, a scalable supervisor is designed for the case of partial observation. The scalable supervisor under partial observation does not need to be recomputed regardless of how many agents are added to or removed from the system. We generalize our earlier results to partial observation by proposing sufficient conditions for safety and maximal permissiveness of the scalable least restrictive supervisor on the template level. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed scalable supervisory synthesis."

This method employs a Gohberg-Semencul factorization of the model covariance matrix, leveraging its Toeplitz structure. Moreover, this approach utilizes a temporal window, not necessarily rectangular, preceding spectral estimation. Krylov matrices facilitate fast matrix inversions. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in electric network frequency estimation when a short time window of 1 second is used in power recordings.

233,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"The non-linear fluorescence emission has been widely applied for high spatial resolution optical imaging. We studied the fluorescence anomalous saturating effect of the nitrogen vacancy defect in diamond. The fluorescence reduction was observed with high power laser excitation. It increased the non-linearity of the fluorescence emission and changed the spatial frequency distribution of the fluorescence image. We used a differential excitation protocol to extract the high spatial frequency information. By modulating the excitation laser's power, the spatial resolution of imaging was improved approximately 1.6 times compared to the confocal microscopy. Due to the simplicity of the experimental setup and data processing, we expect this method can be used for improving the spatial resolution of sensing and biological labeling with defects in solids."
234,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"When random effects are correlated with sample design variables, the typical approach of employing individual survey weights (constructed to be inversely proportional to the unit survey inclusion probabilities) to form a pseudo-likelihood no longer produces asymptotically unbiased inference. We construct a weight-exponentiated formulation for the random effects distribution that achieves unbiased inference for generating hyperparameters of the random effects. Our approach contrasts with frequentist methods that rely on numerical integration to reveal that only the Bayesian method achieves both unbiased estimation with respect to the sampling design distribution and consistency with respect to the population generating distribution. This work serves as a capstone for recent developmental efforts that combine traditional survey estimation approaches with the Bayesian modeling paradigm, providing a bridge across the two rich but disparate subfields."

These main processes replace each other in a temperature range of about 50 degrees. Dielectric spectroscopy also enabled the distinction of two processes of orientational relaxation  the first is due to the rotation of the side mesogenic groups, and the second is associated with the motion of the main chain segments."
237,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,paper_abstract,"Deep hashing methods have shown great retrieval accuracy and efficiency in large-scale image retrieval. To optimize discrete hash bits is the focus in deep hashing methods. A common strategy is to adopt an activation function, e.g. sigmoid or tanh, and minimize a quantization loss to approximate discrete values. However, this paradigm may make more and more hash bits stuck into the wrong saturated area of the activation functions and never escaped. We call this problem ""dead bits problem"". Besides, the existing quantization loss will aggravate the problem. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective gradient amplifier which acts before activation functions to alleviate this problem."

The former is constrained by disappearing charged track searches at the LHC and by dark matter direct detection experiments, while the latter is constrained by existing multilepton collider searches. We find that a two-step electroweak phase transition involving a stable triplet with a negative quadratic term is ruled out by direct detection searches, while an unstable triplet with a mass less than 230 GeV is excluded at 95% confidence level."

In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary disc phase."

Here, we report on measurements of many-body modes in 1D gated-wires using a tunnelling spectroscopy technique.

We combined the kinematic information provided by Gaia for almost all galactic clusters, with the largest sample of cluster ages available after carefully correcting for systematic errors.

Our approach achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on different DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern, and connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously."

Spanning across northern Canada, it is home to the largest remaining wild caribou herd in the world  the George River caribou herd, numbering approximately 400,000 animals. Unfortunately, during my visit, I didn't spot one, but you have the antlers as proof. The boreal forest is blessed with an incredible abundance of wetlands. Wetlands, globally, are one of the most threatened ecosystems. They're absolutely crucial ecosystems, as they clean the air, clean the water, sequester large amounts of greenhouse gases, and support a vast diversity of species."
274,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Before the world of humans began, there was the world of the gods, comprising fields, plains, and gardens. Four brothers roamed this celestial realm, having no family other than each other - they didn't even know who their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, stood out from the others. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers sneaked into Yaya's house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside the gourd, they dropped it."
275,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"So, I graduated from Berkeley seven years ago with a dual degree in molecular and cell biology and linguistics. I attended a career fair on campus, where I secured an interview with a startup called Theranos. At the time, there was limited information available about the company, but what was there was impressive. The company was developing a medical device that enabled users to run their entire blood panel on a finger-stick of blood, eliminating the need for a large needle. This innovation was significant not only for its reduced invasiveness but also for its potential to revolutionize predictive diagnostics."
276,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"My journey to become a polar specialist, specializing in photographing the polar regions, began when I was four years old, when my family moved from southern Canada to northern Baffin Island, up by Greenland. There we lived with the Inuit in the tiny Inuit community of 200 Inuit people, where we were one of three non-Inuit families. In this community, we didn't have a television; we didn't have computers, obviously, or radio. We didn't even have a telephone. All of my time was spent outside with the Inuit, playing. The snow and the ice were my playground, and the Inuit were my teachers. And it was there that I became truly obsessed with this polar realm."
277,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"We're the organization that serves as the safety net for those who've fallen through all other social systems. We receive individuals who've exhausted all other options, people who've fallen through the cracks of society. We don't discriminate by who they are or how long they stay. We contain them, control them, and provide a chance for rehabilitation and rehabilitation."
278,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I'd like to take you on an epic quest to escort and land the Rosetta spacecraft on a comet, a passion that has driven me for the past two years. To achieve this, I must explain the origin of the solar system. Four and a half billion years ago, a cloud of gas and dust existed. At its center, our sun formed and ignited, accompanied by the formation of what we now know as planets, comets, and asteroids. According to theory, after the Earth cooled down slightly after its formation, comets massively impacted the Earth, delivering water and possibly even complex organic material, which may have bootstrapped the emergence of life."
279,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Chris Anderson  Hello, TED community, welcome back for another live conversation. Today's topic is as big as it gets. You know, when we created the ""build back better"" series, our thought was how to address issues arising from the pandemic and how to imagine building back from that. But the events of the past week, including the horrific death of George Floyd and the daily protests that followed, have given us a new sense of urgency. I mean, can we build back better from this? I think before we can even start to answer that question, we must seek to understand the magnitude of this moment."
280,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a three-day camping trip in California's Yosemite Valley. He slept among towering sequoia trees, braved a snowstorm, and spent hours conversing around the campfire with his host and guide, conservationist John Muir. Roosevelt's affinity for the outdoors was well-documented, but Muir's invitation extended beyond mere camping. Yosemite was in peril. Although it had been protected land since 1864, the valley still faced threats from overdevelopment in 1903. This was the culmination of a decades-long struggle to balance preservation and public use – a challenge that proved easier to conceptualize than to execute. The battle for Yosemite began with the 1849 gold rush, when miners flocked to the Sierra Nevada foothills in search of gold."
281,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Hello. This is my first trip, my first time outside the walls of Gaza. I'm thrilled to be here. My lifelong ambition was to be a pilot, to fly a plane, to feel free to soar the sky, to touch the sky. However, that didn't unfold. Simply, I live in Gaza, where there is no airport. All borders are sealed on every side. We reside in one of the largest prisons in the world. The only thing I can do is simply gaze up at the sky. On some days, we are fortunate if we have electricity for four or five hours. When it's cold, we make a fire on the front or on the rooftop of our homes."
282,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I'm unable to share my face with you, as it would put me in danger. My journey began 14 years ago, when I was a young journalist straight out of college. I stumbled upon a scoop - police officers accepting bribes from street vendors. As a rookie reporter, I believed I could do things differently, making a bigger impact, since everyone knew it was happening, yet nothing was being done to stop it. So, I decided to go undercover as a vendor, documenting the evidence. This was immersion journalism, or undercover reporting."
283,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"One simple vitamin can reduce your risk of heart disease. Eating chocolate reduces stress in students. A new drug prolongs lives of patients with a rare disease. Health headlines like these are published every day, sometimes making opposite claims from each other. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines and the often specific, incremental results of the medical research they cover."
284,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"So, when I was 14, my family was in the process of adopting my little brothers from Ethiopia. And one day my mom asked, ""What day should we put for their birthday?"" ""Uh, the day they were born, obviously?"" was a ridiculous question. And then my mom said, ""Well, Kristen, neither of your little brothers have a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find out when that was?"" Mind blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it, except instead of trying to solve the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I try to solve this problem globally."
285,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Imagine if you could plug your brain into a machine that would bring you ultimate pleasure for the rest of your life. If you were given the choice to sign up for that kind of existence, would you? That's the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a thought experiment he called the experience machine. The experiment asks us to consider a world in which scientists have developed a machine that would simulate real life while guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain. The catch is you have to permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly know the difference. Your experiences will be indistinguishable from reality."
286,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"I recall the most embarrassing moment in my years as a palliative care physician, which occurred a couple of years ago. I was consulted by a woman in her 70s, a retired English professor, who had pancreatic cancer. She presented with pain, nausea, and vomiting. During our consultation, she inquired whether medical marijuana might alleviate her symptoms. I reflected on my medical education, which was brief, as I had learned nothing about medical marijuana."
287,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"For the past 24 years, I have been a firefighter in Huntington, West Virginia. As firefighters, my team and I are tasked with saving lives and property from disasters such as car wrecks, house fires, and life-threatening medical emergencies. I am a woman leading a department in a male-dominated profession. Ten years ago, I decided to increase my medical knowledge, and I received a nursing degree. That was because it became clear that the next big threat facing not only my city, but other cities around the country, was not the one-and-done disaster, where you can ride in like the cavalry, as a firefighter, put out the fire and leave, feeling like you have made a difference, but a chronic and ongoing crisis that requires sustained effort and dedication."
288,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Where does all the carbon we release go? Carbon works in a natural cycle, present in all living things  in the soil, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, and in rocks deep underground. When plants and other living things die, much of their stored carbon makes its way back to the atmosphere until new plants grow and reabsorb the carbon. Over millions of years, some of the carbon stored in ancient trees and sea life becomes rock, while some becomes fossil fuels  coal, oil, and natural gas. Natural events like volcanic eruptions release some of the carbon trapped in rock. Additionally, human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, also release some of that prehistoric carbon. Today, humans release around 60 times more carbon than all the volcanoes on the planet each year."
289,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Even nature's most reviled creatures harbor important secrets, but who would welcome a swarm of cockroaches approaching? Yet, one of the most striking differences between natural and human technologies lies in robustness. Robust systems remain stable in complex and uncharted environments. Notably, cockroaches can self-stabilize while running over rugged terrain. When we equipped them with a jet pack or subjected them to an earthquake, we found that their exquisitely tuned legs enable self-stabilization without engaging their brainpower. They effortlessly traverse complex terrain, such as grass, without destabilization. We uncovered a novel behavior where, due to their shape, they instinctively roll onto their side to navigate this artificial grass obstacle."
290,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"These are challenging economic times, fellow entrepreneurs, indeed. I'd like to share a remarkable, albeit lesser-known, commercial success story from the past 20 years. Comparable to the achievements of Microsoft or Google, it's an industry that has weathered the current recession with remarkable resilience. I refer to organized crime, an industry that has been around for a long time, as you say. However, in the last two decades, it has experienced an unprecedented expansion, now accounting for roughly 15% of the world's GDP. I call it the global shadow economy, or mcmafia, for short. So, what triggered this extraordinary growth in cross-border crime?"
291,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"If you ask people what part of psychology do they think is hard, and you say, ""what about thinking and emotions?"" most people will say, ""emotions are terribly hard. They're incredibly complex. They can't — I have no idea of how they work. But thinking is relatively straightforward  it's just sort of logical reasoning, or something. However, that's not the challenging part. Here's a list of problems that come up. One nice problem is, what do we do about health? The other day, I was reading something, and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the West."
292,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"What is a parent? What is a parent? It's not an easy question. Today we have adoption, stepfamilies, and surrogate mothers. Many parents face tough questions and tough decisions. Shall we tell our child about the sperm donation? If so, when? What words to use? Sperm donors are often referred to as ""biological fathers,"" but should we really be using the word ""father""? As a philosopher and social scientist, I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood. But today, I will talk to you about what I learned from talking to parents and children. I will show you that they know what matters most in a family, even though their family looks a little different."
293,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"When I gaze in the mirror today, I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University, a youth mentor, an activist, and a future New York State Senator. (cheering) I see all of that and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison – six years, to be exact, starting as a teenager on Rikers Island for an act that nearly cost a man his life. But what propelled me from there to here wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison or the harshness of our legal system. Instead, it was a learning environment in a classroom that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me or our justice system as a whole."
294,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"What do you think when you look at me? Am I a woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or perhaps oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist? Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. If some of your perceptions were negative, I don't really blame you. That's just how the media has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk to their Uber drivers."
295,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"We need to build a weather service for water. However, until we collectively demand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school, I was framing the questions I would be asked for the next decade. I expected to solve the world's problems, specifically the world's water issues, with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive, believing that our biggest water quality issues persist because they're so hard to detect. And I assumed that we just needed simpler, faster, and more affordable sensors."
296,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Indeed, for 20 years, I worked in finance. I was well-versed in finance, for sure. I knew the global economy intimately because it was my life. All the topics that you could bring up about ecology, the end of the world, etc., that I knew like the back of my hand, I didn't really believe in them. In 2007, an event occurred that I'll never forget, the subprime crisis, the collapse of big American banks. It was an electric shock. I had a few stormy conversations with my wife about the matter, about my job, on the limits of the model. Besides the crisis, I realized that I was completely wrong, that we were heading for disaster."
297,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"So, I'll be speaking to you using language because I can. This is one of the magical abilities that we humans possess. We can transmit complex thoughts to one another. Right now, I'm making sounds with my mouth as I'm exhaling. I'm producing tones, hisses, and puffs, which are creating air vibrations in the air. These air vibrations are traveling to you, hitting your eardrums, and then your brain converts them into thoughts. I hope."
298,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"There's a quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that resonates with me  ""Don't hate the media. Be the media."" As an artist, I'm drawn to media and technology because I'm familiar with their capabilities and appreciate their influence. However, I also acknowledge the immense power they wield. I recall a 2003 interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, discussing the Iraq invasion. When asked about the number of Iraqi casualties, Rumsfeld replied, ""We don't do body counts on other people."""

It's 1988, and scientist James Hansen has just testified to the United States Congress that global warming trends are caused by human activity, and will pose an increasing threat to humanity in the future. Well, well. That's unusually prescient for a human. Looking for a wedding dress? Try a new take on a timeless classic. It's sleek, flattering, and modest—just like the traditional dress."
300,hybrid,none,none,polish_50,speech,"Someone once said that politics is, indeed, ""showbiz for the unattractive."" So, on that basis, I feel like I've truly arrived. The other thing to consider is what an honor it is, as a politician, to deliver a TED Talk, particularly here in the UK, where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has plummeted. There was even a recent story that scientists considered replacing rats in their experiments with politicians. Someone asked, ""Why?"" and they replied, ""Well, there's no shortage of politicians, no one really minds what happens to them, and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."" (Laughter) Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide."
